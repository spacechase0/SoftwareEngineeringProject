# Overview
<!-- 5 points -->
<!-- Give a general overview of the system in 1-2 paragraphs (similar to the one in the project proposal). -->

# Functional Requirements
<!-- 10 points -->
1) Movement of player character (aka Droppy). This includes walking, jumping, crouching, and flying. (Priority: High)
2) Accurate collision of characters with platforms and other characters (Priority: High)
3) Ability to shoot projectiles (beads of water). (Priority: Medium-High)
4) Implementation of enemy characters. (Priority: Medium-High)
5) Interactivity with characters that prompt text boxes (Priority: Medium)
6) Saving current progress of the player through the game (Priority: Medium-Low)
7) Implementation of a main menu and pause menu. (Priority: Low)
<!-- List the functional requirements in sentences identified by numbers and for each requirement state if it is of high, medium, or low priority. Each functional requirement is something that the system shall do. Include all the details required such that there can be no misinterpretations of the requirements when read. Be very specific about what the system needs to do (not how, just what). You may provide a brief design rationale for any requirement which you feel requires explanation for how and/or why the requirement was derived. -->

# Non-functional Requirements
<!-- 10 points -->
1) Story: Gives the player a scenario to follow along, provides context for the adventures the main character goes on.
2) Art: A variety of different digital drawings and animations that add to the visual appeal of the game.
3) Music: Audio to keep the player engaged. Different audio pieces will match for different scenes throughout the game.  
<!-- List the non-functional requirements of the system (any requirement referring to a property of the system, such as security, safety, software quality, performance, reliability, etc.) You may provide a brief rationale for any requirement which you feel requires explanation as to how and/or why the requirement was derived. -->

# Use Case Diagram
<!-- 10 points -->
 ![Usecase diagram](H2GO_Iteration_2.png "Usecase diagram")
<!-- This section presents the use case diagram and the textual descriptions of the use cases for the system under development. The use case diagram should contain all the use cases and relationships between them needed to describe the functionality to be developed. If you discover new use cases between two increments, update the diagram for your future increments.  -->
<!-- Textual descriptions of use cases: For the first increment, the textual descriptions for the use cases are not required. However, the textual descriptions for all use cases discovered for your system are required for the second and third iterations. -->

# Class Diagram and/or Sequence Diagrams
<!-- 15 points -->
![Class Diagram](class_diagram_2.png "Class Diagram")
<!-- This section presents a high-level overview of the anticipated system architecture using a class diagram and/or sequence diagrams. -->
<!-- If the main paradigm used in your project is Object Oriented (i.e., you have classes or something that acts similar to classes in your system), then draw the Class Diagram of the entire system and Sequence Diagrams for the three (3) most important use cases in your system. -->
<!-- If the main paradigm in your system is not Object Oriented (i.e., you do not have classes or anything similar to classes in your system) then only draw Sequence Diagrams, but for all the use cases of your system. In this case, we will use a modified version of Sequence Diagrams, where instead of objects, the lifelines will represent the functions in the system involved in the action sequence. -->
<!-- Class Diagrams show the fundamental objects/classes that must be modeled with the system to satisfy its requirements and the relationships between them. Each class rectangle on the diagram must also include the attributes and the methods of the class (they can be refined between increments).  All the relationships between classes and their multiplicity must be shown on the class diagram. -->
<!-- A Sequence Diagram simply depicts interaction between objects (or functions - in our case - for non-OOP systems) in a sequential order, i.e. the order in which these interactions take place. Sequence diagrams describe how and in what order the objects in a system function. -->

# Operating Environment
<!-- 5 points -->
<!-- Describe the environment in which the software will operate, including the hardware platform, operating system and versions, and any other software components or applications with which it must peacefully coexist. -->

# Assumptions and Dependencies
<!-- 5 points -->
<!-- List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in this document. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project. -->
