# Project Title
<!-- List the title of your project. -->
H2GO

# Brief overview of what you are proposing
<!-- A short description of the project you will develop. No more than 5 sentences.  -->
A 2D platformer game about a sentient water droplet. As the game progresses, the water droplet will gain certain power-ups that will help it progress through levels. There are two main story/power-up paths, one that focuses on being more cloud-like and returning back to the clouds, and the other that focuses more on Earth and helping Earth along the droplet's journey. There will be several levels/stages that leads up to a final boss that, when beaten, will officially end the game.

# Motivation
<!-- Briefly describe why you want to develop this project. -->
Considering that everyone working on this project has had firsthand experience as the consumer of various video games, we all quickly agreed that creating a game would be a fun, engaging project that we would all have passion for working on. 


# Features to be implemented and types of users
<!-- List the features you will implement and a list of types of users/roles if you plan to support different types of users (e.g., regular user, admin, student, coach, etc.) and list the features that each role will be able to access. Be as detailed as possible.  -->
Considering that the project is a game, our target audience will be people who want to play games. 
There will only be one kind of user, and that is the standard, regular user. They will have access to various in-game features such as: 
    
   * Various abilities to be obtained as the player progresses through the game, such as being able to shoot water or turning into water vapor.
   * A timer that runs while the user is playing through the game, the results of which are then presented to the user upon completion of the game. This allows users to accurately perform a "speedrun" of the game, a subgenre of gaming where the player attempts to complete the game as quickly as possible.
   * Two different primary story routes that allow the player to choose which path they want to go down, or how they want to play the game. 
   * Dialogue options and interactions with NPC's (Non-Playable Characters)

# Risks / Challenges
<!-- List any factor that can prevent you from implementing all the features and completing your project. -->
Our primary concern with the development of this project is our lack of experience with the engine we intend on using. While we believe that this will be a very powerful tool that we can use to create our game, there will be a bit of a learning curve attempting to figure out its capabilities. We will have to consider the extra time it will take to adapt ourselves to using the engine, and learning what exactly it can and cannot do.

# Existing related projects
<!-- Do some research to find out if similar applications already exist. If there are similar applications, please mention them (put a link or reference to where you found them) and mention how your application will be different/better than existing projects.  -->
Considering that this game is a platformer, it is only natural to compare it to other games in that genre. For example, some core mechanics of platformers (such as jumping on/shooting enemies to defeat them, or using basic puzzle solving skills to find ways to complete the level) will be maintained in this game. Many other, if not all platformers, share these mechanics (ex. Mario).

After searching, we found [Drop Alive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/513450/Drop_Alive/).
This is also a 2D platformer about a water droplet, however there will be some distinct differences between Drop Alive and H2GO. Drop Alive's main storyline focuses on a lone water drop inside a house that wants to get to the ocean, while H2GO involves traversal through various nature-esque scenes, interaction with other characters, and branching story routes.  

# Intended platform / programming language
<!-- (e.g., iOS, Android, Web, Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, etc.) -->
[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) has a built-in scripting language called GDScript that we plan on using. Our target platform is PC.

# Third-party libraries / APIs to be used
<!-- Please mention any external Web service, library, database, web server, web container, application server, specialized hardware, etc. that you plan to use in your project, to the best of your abilities. -->
We plan on using the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/). Currently, this is the only external service that we intend on using to create our project, code-wise.  [Sibelius](https://www.avid.com/sibelius), a music notation software by Avid, will be used to create the original score for the game.

# Team members, expertise, project responsibilities, and team organization
<!-- List the team members, their FSU IDs, and each memberâ€™s expertise, such as the programming languages, databases, mobile programming, platforms, APIs, etc. each is comfortable with. Mention who will do what during the project. Mention also how your team will be organized (e.g., will you have a manager in charge of delegating tasks or will you decide together based on interests/skills?), what will be your communication like (will you use Slack, Canvas or something similar to communicate? How often will you meet in person?), etc. -->
Everyone will be programming various areas.
* Chase Warrington - caw15d - Purely code
* Amanda Lovett - all17 - Also art
* Carissa Garde - cmg17d - Also music
* Megan Primavera - mlp16c - Also story, QA experience in the gaming industry

Quick, more casual communication will be done through Discord. Plans have been made to meet up every Saturday at 3pm, location varies by the week. If any of our group members has an issue meeting at the allotted time, we have agreed to discuss over Discord either a) an alternate meetup date/time or b) continuing our meeting as scheduled while the missing person takes on the work to be done at said meeting on their own accord.
