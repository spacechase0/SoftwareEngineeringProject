# 2)   Project Title and Description
<!--Briefly describe your project.-->
H2GO is a 2D platforming game made for Windows. The game follows a water droplet called Droppy, who traverses through a variety of terrains in order to save his home. In doing so, Droppy will use his powers to travel the land and fight enemies. An eclectic cast of characters, unique soundtracks, and worlds filled with visual variety help tell his story and engross the player in his adventure. 

# 3)  Accomplishments and overall project status during this increment
<!--Describe in detail what was accomplished during this increment and where your project stands overall compared to the initial scope and functionality proposed.-->
A significant amount of progress was made between the second iteration and the third. Two more intermediary levels have been added; one that represents a grassy terrain, and one that represents a gray, dreary sky. Each level is fully traversable and includes world borders, and triggers that cut to boss fights and/or cutscenes. Implementation of these levels also included graphics, animations, distinct boss fights, and sound effects/music. The damage system was also successfully implemented, and the overall controls and certain mechanics of the game were improved for a smoother playing experience.

# 4)   Challenges, changes in the plan and scope of the project and things that went wrong during this increment
<!--Please describe here in detail:
- anything that was challenging during this increment and how you dealt with the challenges
- any changes that occurred in the initial plan you had for the project or its scope. Describe the reasons for the changes. 
- anything that went wrong during this increment-->

Compared to last iteration, our communication had greatly improved, along with our ability to complete goals and objectives in a more timely manner. We had successfully established our group in a remote setting, and after doing so, we found that work was getting completed at a much better rate. Tasks were being delegated much more efficiently, and we accomplished more as a result. The most significant change we made in terms of scope and the project as a whole was simplifying the story; limiting the number of character interactions and dialog options, and telling the story mostly through still images rather than direct player interactivity. We decided to do this to ensure that we could finish the project on time, given that everyone's situations are very fluid and consistency for work and partner communication could be questionable. This is less of anyone's fault in particular and more of the situation we were put in.

# 5)   Team Member Contribution for this increment
<!--Please list each individual member and their contributions to each of the deliverables in this increment (be as detailed as possible).
In other words, describe the contribution of each team member to:
a)   the progress report, including the sections they wrote or contributed to
b)   the requirements and design document, including the sections they wrote or contributed to
c)   the implementation and testing document, including the sections they wrote or contributed to
d)   the source code (be detailed about which parts of the system each team member contributed to and how)
e)   the video or presentation-->

a) Progress Report: Amanda created the progress report, with references to the previously created progress reports (created by all members).

b) Requirements and Design Document: Work done on the written portion of the requirements and design document was done by Megan and Amanda. Megan has created the Use Case Diagram, while Chase has created Class/Sequence Diagram.

c) Implementation and Testing Document: Work done on the document this increment were created by Megan and Amanda.

d) Source Code: Amanda created and implemented the graphics for Level 2 and Level 3, as well as designed the previously mentioned levels. Megan implemented the damage system, with work on the health display done by Amanda and work on the hurt animation done by Chase. Chase implemented the mechanics for the two boss fights, and provided additional code to various other elements in the game (ex. enemy pathfinding, vapor bar improvements). Carissa implemented music and soundtrack for the game as well as fixed minor errors in the code where necessary.

e) Video: TBD
