# 2)   Project Title and Description
<!--Briefly describe your project.-->
H2GO is a 2D platforming game made for Windows. The game follows a water droplet called Droppy, who traverses through a variety of terrains in order to save his home. In doing so, Droppy will gain powers, fights enemies, and be able to converse with an eclectic cast of characters. 

# 3)  Accomplishments and overall project status during this increment
<!--Describe in detail what was accomplished during this increment and where your project stands overall compared to the initial scope and functionality proposed.-->
As of right now, there is a current executable of the game that simply involves Droppy (with art included) running, jumping, crouching, turning into water vapor (aka flying), and shooting projectiles. Additionally, two unique sound files have been created for the game, and the first three levels are planned out, though not designed. Some other art elements, such as a non-playable character named Twiggy, and a cloud platform have been drawn out. 

# 4)   Challenges, changes in the plan and scope of the project and things that went wrong during this increment
<!--Please describe here in detail:
- anything that was challenging during this increment and how you dealt with the challenges
- any changes that occurred in the initial plan you had for the project or its scope. Describe the reasons for the changes. 
- anything that went wrong during this increment-->
Thankfully, there were no challenges that were so significant that our progress was negatively impacted. Small errors could be attributed to learning the scripting language, for example, Droppy's face not aligning properly with his body when crouching. Currently, there are no plans to deviate from the original plans or scope for this project.
