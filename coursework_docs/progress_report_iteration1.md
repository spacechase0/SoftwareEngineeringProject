# 2)   Project Title and Description
<!--Briefly describe your project.-->
H2GO is a 2D platforming game made for Windows. The game follows a water droplet called Droppy, who traverses through a variety of terrains in order to save his home. In doing so, Droppy will gain powers, fights enemies, and be able to converse with an eclectic cast of characters. 

# 3)  Accomplishments and overall project status during this increment
<!--Describe in detail what was accomplished during this increment and where your project stands overall compared to the initial scope and functionality proposed.-->
As of right now, there is a current executable of the game that simply involves Droppy (with art included) running, jumping, crouching, turning into water vapor (aka flying), and shooting projectiles. Additionally, two unique sound files have been created for the game, and the first three levels are planned out, though not designed. Some other art elements, such as a non-playable character named Twiggy, and a cloud platform have been drawn out. 

# 4)   Challenges, changes in the plan and scope of the project and things that went wrong during this increment
<!--Please describe here in detail:
- anything that was challenging during this increment and how you dealt with the challenges
- any changes that occurred in the initial plan you had for the project or its scope. Describe the reasons for the changes. 
- anything that went wrong during this increment-->
Thankfully, there were no challenges that were so significant that our progress was negatively impacted. Small errors could be attributed to learning the scripting language, for example, Droppy's face not aligning properly with his body when crouching. Currently, there are no plans to deviate from the original plans or scope for this project. 

# 5)   Team Member Contribution for this increment
<!--Please list each individual member and their contributions to each of the deliverables in this increment (be as detailed as possible).
In other words, describe the contribution of each team member to:
a)   the progress report, including the sections they wrote or contributed to
b)   the requirements and design document, including the sections they wrote or contributed to
c)   the implementation and testing document, including the sections they wrote or contributed to
d)   the source code (be detailed about which parts of the system each team member contributed to and how)
e)   the video or presentation-->

a) Progress Report: Every team member contributed to the document; however, we did so verbally at a meeting so most of the edits appear to only have been done by Amanda. 

b) Requirements and Design Document: Every team member contributed to the document; however, we did so verbally at a meeting so most of the edits appear to only have been done by Amanda. 

c) Implementation and Testing Document: Every team member contributed to the document; however, we did so verbally at a meeting so most of the edits appear to only have been done by Amanda. Megan created the Use Case diagram via Creately but team members verbally came up with the use cases. Class Diagram was done by {insert team member name}

d) Source Code: Chase implemented code relating to the platforming and physics of the game, Carissa implmented the audio player, Amanda implemented code relating to graphics and animation, and Megan created the dialogue box and timed message system.

e) Video: 


# 6)   Plans for the next increment
<!--If this report if for the first or second increment, describe what are you planning to achieve in the next increment.-->
Upcoming plans include level design, implementation of interactive characters (ie. NPC's, Enemies), and dialogue.


# 7)   Link to video
<!--Paste here the link to your video (only for increment 1 and 2).-->
