# 2)   Project Title and Description
<!--Briefly describe your project.-->
H2GO is a 2D platforming game made for Windows. The game follows a water droplet called Droppy, who traverses through a variety of terrains in order to save his home. In doing so, Droppy will use his powers, fight enemies, and be able to converse with an eclectic cast of characters. 

# 3)  Accomplishments and overall project status during this increment
<!--Describe in detail what was accomplished during this increment and where your project stands overall compared to the initial scope and functionality proposed.-->
The first level, which serves as a tutorial level to get the user acquainted with the game's features and functionality, has been mapped out and is in a playable state. The level uses dialogue boxes to guide the player through the level while showcasing Droppy's various abilities. Additional artwork and animation, such as a distinct ending point for the level and a seagull enemy, have also been implemented. Extra code has been added to support the enemy's movement and visuals, and code for damage is currently in the works (though not finished). The story and level planning have been completed, with the implementation of such components to be completed in the third iteration. 


# 4)   Challenges, changes in the plan and scope of the project and things that went wrong during this increment
<!--Please describe here in detail:
- anything that was challenging during this increment and how you dealt with the challenges
- any changes that occurred in the initial plan you had for the project or its scope. Describe the reasons for the changes. 
- anything that went wrong during this increment-->

Needless to say, the circumstances regarding COVID-19 have made completion of this project much more daunting. Between getting our personal lives in order and organizing our group under forced remote circumstances, it has unfortunately thrown our progress off track. In order to cope with this better, we have decided to scrap the idea of branching the story/level design on two distinct paths, and instead opt for one linear story path that the player progresses on. Our goal for this increment, in a very basic sense, was to have the core functionality of the game as a whole established, which was mostly accomplished. We were able to add a cutscene trigger and dialogue triggers, multiple platforms, an enemy, and a pause menu as well as a camera that follows the player and borders that prevent the player from going out of bounds. 

<!--Note: Code will be worked on today (4/3) and what was/wasn't accomplished, or compromises will be discussed here -->

# 6)   Plans for the next increment
<!--If this report if for the first or second increment, describe what are you planning to achieve in the next increment.-->

The primary goal for next increment will involve creating the subsequent levels and characters, while also polishing our current work. Functions such as damage and the overall game timer will be added as well.
