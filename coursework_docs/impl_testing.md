# Programming Languages
<!-- 5 points -->
GDScript - Godot's in-house scripting language, using due to ease of access and efficient management of programming/game designing capabilities.

# Platforms, APIs, Databases, and other technologies used

# Execution-based Functional Testing
<!-- 10 points -->
<!--Basic character movement function has been determined and tested, namely:
- A change in form/artwork for normal walking, crouching, and flying (aka water vapor)
- The ability to stand on platforms without phasing through them
- The ability to shoot projectiles but only when in normal form--!>
<!-- Describe how/if you performed functional testing for your project (i.e., tested for the functional requirements listed in your RD). -->

# Execution-based Non-Functional Testing
<!-- 10 points -->
<!-- Describe how/if you performed non-functional testing for your project (i.e., tested for the non-functional requirements listed in your RD). -->

# Non-Execution-based Testing
<!-- 10 points -->
<!--Components such as art, story, character design, and music have all been presented to every member of the group, and changes have been made where necessary. Code has been uploaded and shared through Git, and those working on the code have partaken in reviews to ensure functionality.--!>
<!-- Describe how/if you performed non-execution-based testing (such as code reviews/inspections/walkthroughs). -->
