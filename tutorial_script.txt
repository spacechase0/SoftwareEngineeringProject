
ZEPH: Droppy! Where are you off to?
ZEPH: Huh? Mr. Nimbus’ place? All by yourself? That’s so cool! I wish I could go…Wait, do you even know how to get there? You know there’s tons of dangers along the way. You could evaporate or something.
[ZEPH goes silent]
ZEPH: Wait, I know! I’ll just remind you! Follow me.
[DROPPY does not move]
ZEPH: Uh, hey. Did you forget how to walk or something? Come on, you’re a droplet! Geez, I guess I have to remind you of that too. 
ZEPH: You just use A and D! Duh. 
[DROPPY moves until they reach a platform that ZEPH has jumped on]
ZEPH: What are you still doing down there?
ZEPH: What do you mean you don’t know how to get up here? Just use Space! You gotta remember how to jump!

[DROPPY jumps until they reach a place where he must crouch]
ZEPH: Well of course you can’t fit in here! You gotta duck! Do you remember how to do that?
ZEPH: Yeah! That’s right use S!

[Tutorial continues until they reach one cloud platform, camera pans to a sleeping seagull]

ZEPH: Shh! Don’t move Droppy. 
ZEPH: It’s our archnemesis. He’ll attack if we aren’t careful. 

[The seagull snores]
ZEPH: Wait, do you remember how to attack?
ZEPH: Well go practice! 

[DROPPY starts to move]
ZEPH: WAIT BEFORE YOU GO!
ZEPH: Remember that you could punch him…but you’d probably get hurt. You can try it with [insert move pls]. You should probably just…jump on him with space though.

[DROPPY fights the Seagull]
[Seagull is defeated]
[DROPPY continues moving until they reach Mr. Nimbus’ house]
ZEPH: You know I had my doubts but you’re still pretty good at all this!
ZEPH: Well, I guess I should..let you go see Mr. Nimbus..without me.
[ZEPH starts to walk away]
ZEPH: Oh before I go, if you ever forget, you can just think about what we did! I think you just have to..hit [PAUSE COMMAND] but hey, I’m no sage. That’s probably why you’re here. 
ZEPH: Well, have fun! See you later!
